<p align="left"><b>fresh cheese = unripened cheese = curd cheeses = curd-style
cheeses</b>
<p align="left">Most
fresh cheese is made by curdling milk with an enzyme, and then draining off the
whey.&nbsp; The curds that remain are molded into cheese.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fresh cheeses
tend to be bland, so they're often used as vehicles for
other flavorings.&nbsp; Some, like cream cheese, are used to make dips or
cheesecakes.&nbsp; Others, like ricotta cheese, are used as fillings for dumplings,
pasta, crepes, or pastries.&nbsp;&nbsp;Still others, like cottage cheese, can be a meal
all by themselves once they're perked up with herbs, fruit, or other flavorings.&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align="left">Fresh
cheeses have a higher moisture content and are usually lower in fat and sodium than other
cheeses.&nbsp; Most are highly
perishable, so check the expiration date when you buy them and keep them tightly
wrapped or covered in the refrigerator.&nbsp; Moist fresh cheeses like cottage
cheese and ricotta should be eaten within a week of purchase; firmer cheeses
like cream cheese and farmer's cheese can usually be stored for about two
weeks.&nbsp; Don't eat fresh cheese if mold appears on it.&nbsp;<p align="left">Tips:
<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Fresh cheese work best in cold dishes.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Fresh cheeses tend to break when added to hot sauces, so add
    them at the last minute.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Lactose-intolerant people may prefer aged cheese over fresh,
    since aged cheese contains less lactose.

        This simple, mild cheese was traditionally produced in Europe's
        &quot;cottages&quot; from the milk left over from butter making.&nbsp; It's
        versatile, easy to digest, and
        a good source of protein.&nbsp; It's sold with either large or small curds,
        and with fruit or chives sometimes added.&nbsp; Use it within a few
days after purchasing and discard if mold appears.&nbsp; It's best served
        chilled. <i><b>To make your own:&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>  </i>To make 2 cups
        (one pound), heat a gallon of skim milk to 80ºF (27ºC) using a double
        boiler (don't use aluminum or cast iron). Dissolve 1/4 tablet of rennet in a few tablespoons of cold water, then stir
        it into the milk using a whisk for a few minutes. Turn off the heat,
        cover, and let the mixture sit for about five hours at room
        temperature.&nbsp; Use a knife to cut the curds into half-inch cubes,
        then let them sit for about 15 minutes more.&nbsp;

        another 15 minutes).&nbsp; Hold it at this temperature for another 30
        minutes.&nbsp; Be sure to raise the temperature gradually, or the curds

are available, and they work quite well in cheesecakes.&nbsp; Use the cheese within a few days after
