        <p align="left">Chocolate's
        notoriously hard to work with.&nbsp; If you don't store it properly
        (preferably at 65° or so), the cocoa butter can separate slightly from
        the solids, causing the chocolate to &quot;bloom.&quot;&nbsp; This
        leaves a telltale gray residue on the surface and impairs the taste and
        texture slightly.&nbsp;&nbsp; Chocolate will scorch if you melt it at
        too high a temperature, or &quot;seize&quot; and become thick and grainy
        if you add even a drop of cold liquid to it as it's melting.&nbsp; You can
        prevent it from seizing by adding hot liquids (like cream) to chopped
        chocolate in order to melt it, or by making sure that anything you're
        dipping into the melted chocolate (like a strawberry or whisk) is
        perfectly dry.&nbsp; If your chocolate has seized, you can still use it
        in any recipe that calls for chocolate to be blended with a
        liquid.&nbsp; Just add the liquid to the chocolate and melt it
        again.&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align="left">If you plan to melt chocolate, it's
        best to buy it in bars.&nbsp; Chips contain less cocoa butter so that
        they can better hold their shape in cookies, but this makes them harder
        to melt and less tasty.&nbsp; It's easiest to melt chocolate in a
        microwave oven.&nbsp; Just break the chocolate into small pieces, heat
        it for 30 seconds at 50% power, stir, then repeat a few times.&nbsp;
        Take it out of the microwave when the chocolate is almost completely
        melted, then continue stirring until the melting is complete.&nbsp; If
        you don't have a microwave, use a double boiler.</td>

for carob measure for measure, but since cocoa has a stronger flavor, you should
        use less.&nbsp; Cocoa powder has more fat than carob powder,

One cup of chips = 6 ounces; if melting the chocolate, chips and squares
are interchangeable.&nbsp; <b><i>Notes:&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></b> This is similar to
        semi-sweet chocolate, only it has a bit more sugar.&nbsp; It can be used
        interchangeably with bittersweet and semi-sweet chocolate in most
        recipes.&nbsp;&nbsp; Baker's Chocolate calls its sweet chocolate <b>German chocolate</b>.&nbsp;
        <i><b>Substitutes:&nbsp; </b></i>semi-sweet chocolate OR bittersweet
        chocolate OR 1 ounce sweet chocolate = 1 ounce
unsweetened baking chocolate + 4 teaspoons sugar OR 1 ounce sweet chocolate = 1 tablespoon unsweetened
cocoa + 4 teaspoons sugar + 2 teaspoons unsalted butter (may leave a powdery
taste, but makes product moister and more flavorful.)

        What kid hasn't sneaked a bar of this out of the kitchen, only to

        Since the FDA won't let American producers label a product&nbsp;

        chocolate scorches
easily, so cook it gently.&nbsp;&nbsp; Bars and wafers usually taste better than chips.&nbsp;
        Avoid white chocolate that's made with vegetable oil instead of cocoa
        butter--it's cheaper but not nearly as good.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i><b>Substitutes:</b></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;
