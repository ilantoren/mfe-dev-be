Nut flours are ground from the cake that remains after oils are pressed from
nuts.&nbsp; They're great for breading fish or chicken, and they add a rich
flavor to baked goods.&nbsp;&nbsp; Nut flour lacks the gluten that baked goods
need to rise, so in those recipes substitute no more than 1/4 of the wheat flour
with nut flour.&nbsp; Nut flours go stale quickly, so store them in the
refrigerator or freezer, and use them up quickly.&nbsp; <i><b>Substitutes:&nbsp;

      Nut meals are ground from whole nuts, and are grittier and oilier than nut
      flours, which are ground from the cake that remains after the oils are
      pressed from nuts.&nbsp;&nbsp; To make your own nut meals, grind toasted nuts in a nut mill until the meal has the consistency of
      cornmeal.&nbsp; You can also use a food processor fitted with a steel
      blade to do this, but it's hard to keep the nut meal from turning into nut
      butter.&nbsp; It helps to freeze the nuts before grinding, to use the
      pulse setting on the processor, and to add any sugar in the recipe to the
      nuts to help absorb the oils.&nbsp; Store nut meals in the refrigerator or
      freezer, and use them soon after you buy or&nbsp; make them.&nbsp; <b><i>Substitutes:&nbsp;</i></b>

butter.&nbsp; It helps to work with just a small batch of nuts at a time, and to

<p><b>praline powder&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Notes:&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></b>&nbsp; This
is used to flavor ice cream and pastry fillings.&nbsp; It's made from pralines,
a crunchy French candy that resembles peanut brittle, except that it's made with
almonds or hazelnuts.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can buy praline powder ready made, but
it's easy to make your own by pulverizing praline pieces in a food
processor.&nbsp; Be sure to use crunchy pralines, not the soft pecan candies
that people in New Orleans call pralines.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
