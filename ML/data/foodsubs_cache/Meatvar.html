      Variety meats is a catch-all term for the organ meats, feet, and tails of
butchered animals.&nbsp; Earlier civilizations treated many of the organs as
prized delicacies, and deservedly so since they're often as tender and mildly
flavorful as the finest cuts of meat.&nbsp; They're fallen into disfavor in our
times, though, which means that you can get many of these meats for a
song.&nbsp;&nbsp;Refrigerate variety meats and use them within two days of
purchase, or else freeze them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

    <td width="65%"><b><a href="MeatvarHeart.html">heart</a>&nbsp; </b>Long ago,
      primitive tribes believed that eating heart gave them strength and
      courage.&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, few of us bother to test that theory.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      It's our loss, because heart is tender and has a very delicate flavor.&nbsp;
      It's also quite inexpensive, thanks to its lack of popularity.&nbsp; To
      prepare it, you should rinse it in cold water, then cut out any blood
      vessels and connective tissue.&nbsp; Veal or lamb heart is delicious if
      you sauté or grill it until it's medium rare.&nbsp; If you cook it until
      it's well done, it becomes very tough.&nbsp; Alternatively, you can cook
      heart slowly using moist heat.&nbsp;

      are nutritious and, if properly prepared, delicious.&nbsp; It's often hard
      to find them in markets, though, since many of them are ruined during the
      meat inspection process.&nbsp; Veal kidneys and lamb kidneys are prized
      for their tenderness and delicate flavor.&nbsp;&nbsp; They can be grilled
      or sautéed, though they become tough if overcooked.&nbsp; Pork and beef
      kidneys are tougher, and need to be cooked slowly using moist heat.&nbsp;&nbsp;

      rich in iron and Vitamin A and has an unabashed flavor that nicely
      complements that of its usual companion, onion.&nbsp;&nbsp; Calf's liver
      is considered to be the best, but lamb liver and beef liver are almost as
      good and much less expensive.&nbsp;&nbsp; Liver can be cooked with dry
      heat, say by grilling or sautéing it, but it becomes very tough if it's
      cooked beyond medium rare.&nbsp;&nbsp; Since liver has very little fat,
      you might want to baste it or lard it.</td>
