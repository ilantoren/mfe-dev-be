    <td width="75%">Wine is an alcoholic beverage made from the fermented juice of
      fruit, usually grapes.&nbsp; There are four broad categories:&nbsp;
      table wines, <a href="WinesSparkling.html">sparkling wines</a>, <a href="Aperitif.html">fortified
      wines</a>, and <a href="WinesFruit.html"> fruit wines</a>.&nbsp; Table wines are the most common, and
      they're grouped by color--red, white, and blush, which
      is sometimes called ros&eacute;.&nbsp; A red wine should be served at room
      temperature, and it goes well with hearty, meat-based dishes like steak
      and spaghetti.&nbsp; White and blush wines should be served chilled, and
      they go best with lighter fare, like fish and chicken.&nbsp; Many wines,
      called varietals, are named after the variety of grape used to make them.&nbsp; Cabernet
      Sauvignon, Zinfandel, and Pinot Noir are popular red varietals, while
      Chardonnay, Chenin Blanc, and Johannisberg Riesling are popular white
      ones.&nbsp; In Europe, some wines, often blends of different varietals,
      are named after the place where the wine is produced, like Bordeaux,
      Burgundy, Chablis, Rhine, and Rhône.&nbsp; These European wines are often
      superb, but American wines that have borrowed these regional names, like
      California Chablis, are almost always mediocre.&nbsp; If you're buying a
      domestic wine, it's often better to go with a varietal, like a California
      Cabernet Sauvignon.&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><i>Substitutes: &nbsp;</i></b>equal parts grape juice and
broth (in stews and sauces) OR wine essence OR coffee (in baked chocolate or nut dishes) OR&nbsp;fruit
juice (in baked fruit dishes) OR vinegar (in marinades) OR broth OR verjus (in
      salad dressings) OR lemon juice (in salad dressings)</td>

<p><b>cooking wine&nbsp; <i>Notes:&nbsp;&nbsp; </i></b>You should never cook
with a wine you wouldn't drink, but some &quot;cooking wines&quot; sold at
stores violate this maxim.&nbsp;&nbsp; Avoid them and instead cook with inexpensive, but drinkable,
table wines.&nbsp;&nbsp; Avoid putting wine in aluminum or iron pans for prolonged
      periods.&nbsp;</p>

These aren't as flavorful as ordinary wine, but they're a good choice for
people who want to drink wine without consuming alcohol.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Sparkling wines are the most popular de-alcoholized wines, but other varieties
are also available.&nbsp; Many brands contain small amounts of
alcohol.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <i><b>Substitutes:&nbsp; </b></i>wine essence OR sparkling grape
juice OR sparkling cider OR equal parts verjus and club soda, sweetened to taste
with simple syrup. OR wine (Alcohol evaporates at a lower temperature than water, so
cooking with wine will eliminate some or even most of the alcohol, but not all
of it.)</td>

<p><b>Kosher wine = Passover wine&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Notes:&nbsp; </i></b>This is wine
that's been made in accordance with Rabbinical law.&nbsp;&nbsp; Most people
think of them as syrupy-sweet screw-top wines made with Concord grapes, but some kosher wines are now being
produced that are indistinguishable from quality non-kosher wines.&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless
pasteurized, a wine can only remain kosher if
it's poured by an observant Jew.&nbsp;&nbsp;Bottles of pasteurized wine sport the
label &quot;mevushal.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
