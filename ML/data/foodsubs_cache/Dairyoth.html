to the amount of butterfat they have. Lightest of all is <b><a href="#half-and-half">half
&amp; half</a></b>, which is half milk, half cream and weighs in with a
butterfat content between 10.5 - 18%.&nbsp; It can't be whipped, but it's
nice with coffee, or on cereal.&nbsp; <b><a href="#light cream">Light cream

still can't be whipped.&nbsp; <b><a href="#light whipping">Light whipping
cream = whipping cream</a> </b>(with a butterfat content of 30 - 36%) and
<b><a href="#heavy">heavy
cream = heavy whipping cream</a> </b>(with at least 36% fat) are heavy
enough to whip, and aren't as prone as lower-fat creams to curdling in
sauces. The higher the butterfat content, the less beating is required
to get whipped cream.&nbsp; Europeans go for even heavier creams, like
<b>double
cream</b> (with a butterfat content of 42%), <b>extra-thick double cream</b>,
and <b><a href="#clotted cream">clotted cream = Devonshire cream</a></b>,
which is often spread like butter over scones. Look for clotted cream in
large supermarkets, but (perhaps luckily) the double creams are very hard
to find. You can buy <b>ultra-pasteurized</b> versions of these creams,
but they tend to have a burnt milk taste and don't whip as well.&nbsp; <b><i>Substitutes:&nbsp;
</i></b>evaporated milk (This is lower in fat, and it's hard to whip.&nbsp; It
also has a slight burnt milk taste.) OR yogurt (This tends to curdle in hot
sauces or soups, but it works well in cold soups.)

  decades ago, the cream in milk would rise to the top and a glass of milk

  commercial milk today is homogenized so that the fat is broken into small
  particles which remain suspended in the milk, and pasteurized to kill

  isn't pasteurized; producers instead keep their cows and dairies clean in
  order to reduce the risk of bacterial contamination.&nbsp; Some people insist
  raw milk is more healthful than commercial milk since it contains active
  enzymes that help with digestion and absorption of nutrients.&nbsp; Many
  cheesemakers prefer it since pasteurization diminishes the cheese's flavor
  potential and homogenization gives it a waxy texture.&nbsp; Unfortunately,
  it's illegal to sell raw milk in many states.&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><i>Substitutes</i></b>:&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Nonfat milk mixed with whipping cream (When making cheese, this corrects the
  texture problem resulting from homogenization.) OR powdered lowfat milk mixed
