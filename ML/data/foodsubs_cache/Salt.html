  <p><i><b>Tips:</b></i></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Adding salt to water will raise the temperature at which it boils and
      lower the temperature at which it freezes.</li>
    <li>Though we need some salt in our diet, most Americans consume much more
      than necessary.&nbsp; Too much salt can lead to high blood pressure.</li>
    <li>Salt is a terrific flavor enhancer, helping to reduce bitterness and
      acidity, and bringing out other flavors in the food.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Adding salt to bread dough controls the action of the yeast and improves
      the flavor.&nbsp; Bread made without salt will have a coarser texture and
      a blander flavor than bread made with salt.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Try sprinkling salt on citrus fruit, melons, tomatoes, and even wine to
      enhance flavor.</li>
    <li>Adding a little salt balances the flavor of sweets like cakes, cookies,
      and candies.</li>
    <li>Boiling eggs in salted water makes them easier to peel.</li>
    <li>Adding a pinch of salt (preferably non-iodized) to cream or egg whites
      before they're whipped increases their volume and serves as a
      stabilizer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Salt is a mineral, so it can be stored indefinitely without going
      stale.&nbsp; It won't taste any fresher if you grind it with a salt
      mill.</li>
    <li>Salt has been used for millennia as a preservative for meats, fish,
      cheese, and other foods.&nbsp; It works by absorbing moisture from the
      cells of bacteria and mold through osmosis, which kills them or leaves
      them unable to reproduce.</li>
    <li>Salting slices of eggplants helps draw out the bitter
      juices.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Sprinkling salt on meat before broiling or grilling it draws moisture
      from the center, making it browner on the outside, but less juicy on the
      inside.&nbsp;</li>
  </ul>
  <p><b><i>Substitutes:</i></b> &nbsp;citrus zest (for seasoning) OR pepper (for seasoning) OR&nbsp;herbs
(for seasoning) OR soy sauce (for seasoning) OR hatcho miso (especially in
hearty soups and stews; 1 teaspoon salt = 2 tablespoons hatcho miso) OR salt
  substitute&nbsp;OR kelp powder OR omit (Reducing salt in a recipe
reduces sodium, but doing so may impair flavor and, in the case of baked goods, texture.
Since salt enhances flavorings, use more of them if you reduce salt in a recipe.)

    <td width="74%"><b>French sea salt = sel marin&nbsp;&nbsp;</b><p>This
      expensive French salt comes from sea water that's pooled into basins and
      then evaporated.&nbsp; Unlike most American sea salts, it's unrefined, so
      it retains more of the minerals that naturally occur in seawater.&nbsp;
      There are several varieties.&nbsp; <b>Gray salt = grey salt = sel gris&nbsp;</b>gets
      its color from the clay lining the basins.&nbsp; <b>La</b> <b>fleur de sel
      </b>(the flower of the salt) is whiter, but has a similar flavor.</p>
      <p>That trendy gourmets are willing
      to shell out $5 for a small packet of French sea salt drives chemists crazy, since almost all
      of it is just plain salt, sodium chloride, NaCl.&nbsp;&nbsp; Salt aficionados
      counter that French sea salt has a much softer and fresher flavor than
      ordinary table salt, and that the difference is worth it.</p>
      <p>These salts comes either coarsely or finely ground.&nbsp; Since salt is
      an inorganic mineral, there's no point in grinding large crystals with a salt
      mill so they'll be &quot;fresh.&quot;&nbsp; Salt, unlike
      pepper and spices, never goes stale. It's best to use these salts after

      for the preparation of kosher meats, but many cooks prefer it over table salt.&nbsp; It
      has coarser grains, so it's easier to use if you, like professional chefs,
      toss salt into pots with your fingers, measuring by touch.&nbsp; Most
      kosher salt is also flaked, giving each grain a larger surface area.&nbsp;
      This helps the salt adhere better, so it's great for lining margarita
      glasses, and for making a salt crust on meats or fish. Kosher salt also is
      preferred over table salt for canning and pickling.&nbsp; Like pickling
      salt, kosher salt is free of iodine, which can react adversely with certain
      foods.&nbsp; Some brands of kosher salt contain yellow prussiate of soda,
      an anti-caking agent, but unlike the anti-caking additive in table salt,
      it doesn't cloud pickling liquids.&nbsp; The only drawback to using kosher
      salt for pickling or canning is that the grains are coarser and flakier,
      and can't be packed as tightly into a measuring cup as pickling
      salt.&nbsp; This raises the risk that the salt won't be properly measured.
      To get around this problem, measure by weight instead
      of volume.&nbsp; With its large grains, kosher salt isn't a good choice
      for baking.&nbsp; Look for boxes of it in the spice section of
      your supermarket.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i><b>Substitutes:&nbsp;</b></i>&nbsp;
      pickling salt OR Margarita salt OR table salt (smaller grains, use half as

  large bags or boxes in supermarkets, but it's hard to find in cities.&nbsp; In
  addition to pickling or canning with it, you can also use pickling salt just as you would ordinary table salt, though
  without the anti-caking agents it may
  get lumpy if exposed to moisture.&nbsp; To prevent lumps, put a few grains of rice in

the cheap, non-food grade salt that we throw onto icy walkways and use to make
ice cream.&nbsp; It doesn't actually go into the ice cream, as
some have learned the hard way, but rather into the wooden ice-filled tub that surrounds the bucket
of ice cream.&nbsp; The salt lowers the
freezing point of the ice, which causes it to melt.&nbsp; As it melts, it
absorbs heat from the ice cream, helping it to freeze more quickly.&nbsp; Use a
ratio of one part rock salt for every five parts of ice.&nbsp; If you're out of rock salt, other kinds of salt will
also work, though you should use less
since finer grains of salt can can be packed
more densely into a cup than large chunks of rock salt.&nbsp; The biggest
danger is that you'll use too much salt, which will make your ice cream freeze
too fast and become crusty.&nbsp; When using salt other than rock salt, start with a modest amount and check the ice cream after you've churned it
for ten minutes.&nbsp; If the ice cream is just beginning to firm up, you have
the right amount of salt.&nbsp; If it's not yet firming up, you need to add more
salt.&nbsp;&nbsp; If it's crusty along the sides of the bucket, then you've

  salt substitutes are herbal blends, which enhance the flavor of food without

                          Cardia®, and Lite Salt®, replace some or all of the
  sodium chloride (ordinary salt) with potassium chloride, which has a slightly
  bitter taste.&nbsp; These substitutes are sometimes recommended for people on
  sodium-restricted diets.&nbsp; It's recommended that you consult a physician
  before using these products, especially if you have diabetes or kidney disease, or
  if you're taking diuretics or potassium                  supplements, or if

      The anti-caking agent in both iodized and non-iodized salt doesn't
      dissolve in water, so if you pickle or can with it, it will turn the
      liquid cloudy or else settle on the bottom of the jar.&nbsp; The preserved
      food will taste the same, mind you, but it won't look as
      appealing.&nbsp; This is more of a problem for pickles, which are immersed
