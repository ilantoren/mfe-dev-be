This is a thick, sweet syrup that's popular in America, but hard to find in
      other countries.&nbsp;&nbsp; Unlike other sweeteners, corn syrup doesn't
      crystallize and turn grainy when it's cold, so it's a good choice for frostings, fudge sauces, and
      candies.&nbsp; Baked goods made with corn syrup are moister and stay
      fresher longer than those made with sugar.&nbsp; There are two
      types:&nbsp; <b><a href="#dark corn syrup">dark
corn syrup</a></b>  is dark brown and has a slight molasses flavor, while <b><a href="#light corn syrup">light corn syrup</a></b>

      behind after the juices are boiled a second time.&nbsp; It's less sweet
      but more flavorful than light molasses, and it's a good choice if a recipe
      simply calls for molasses. <b>Blackstrap molasses</b> comes from the third
      and final boiling.&nbsp; It's too strong and bitter for most recipes, and
      it's mostly consumed for its alleged nutritional benefits.&nbsp;&nbsp;Most

      as cattle feed or as a medium for growing yeast. &nbsp;When measuring
      molasses, grease the cup and utensils to keep molasses from sticking.&nbsp; If
      your molasses crystallizes while being stored, heat it gently to dissolve
      the crystals.&nbsp; After opening, you can store molasses in your
      cupboard.&nbsp; <b><i>Substitutes: </i></b>dark corn syrup OR maple
