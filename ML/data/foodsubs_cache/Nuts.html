      <td width="68%">Cooks and grocers define nuts as anything with edible
        kernels and hard shells.&nbsp; This includes true nuts like chestnuts
        and acorns, but also things that botanists would class as seeds, like
        Brazil nuts, or legumes, like peanuts.&nbsp; Nuts are usually high in
        fat and protein, and people throughout the world eat them as snacks or
        incorporate them into both sweet and savory dishes.&nbsp; Many nuts can be
        eaten raw but roasting them helps intensify their flavor. &nbsp;&nbsp;Nuts
        are usually harvested in the fall, and it's best to buy unprocessed nuts
        then.&nbsp;&nbsp; Many unshelled nuts can be kept for up to a year in a
        cool place, but shelled nuts, especially those that have been cut or
        roasted, are more prone to rancidity and should be stored in the
        refrigerator or freezer in an airtight container.&nbsp; <b><i>Substitutes:&nbsp; </i></b>Grape-nuts cereal

  oak trees, and they were once an important food for Native
  Americans.&nbsp;&nbsp; Before they can be eaten, most acorns need to
  be treated to remove the bitter tannins in them.&nbsp;&nbsp; To do this, boil whole
  shelled acorns in water, replacing the water with fresh boiling water whenever
  it turns light brown. Keep doing this for about two hours, until the water no
  longer changes color.&nbsp;&nbsp; Alternatively, you can soak the shelled
  acorns in several changes of water for three or four days.&nbsp; Some Native
  Americans do this by putting whole or pounded acorns into nylon stockings and
  hanging them so that they're immersed in the water of a toilet tank
  (repeat:&nbsp; tank, not bowl).&nbsp; Each time the toilet is flushed, the
  water in the tank is refreshed.&nbsp; This may discolor the toilet,
  however.&nbsp; After the nuts have been leached of tannins, roast them in a
  350° oven for about an hour.&nbsp; They can then be eaten whole or ground
  into acorn meal and used to make porridges or breads.&nbsp; Acorns from white
  oaks aren't nearly as bitter as those from red or black oaks, and can be
  roasted without first soaking them.&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><i>Substitutes:&nbsp; </i></b>hazelnuts

      </i></b>These sweet, starchy, low-fat nuts are quite common in southern

      stuffing, and desserts.&nbsp; They appear fresh in the fall and winter,
      but you can find them dried, vacuum-packed, or canned throughout the
      year.&nbsp; Before you can eat them, fresh chestnuts need to be boiled or
      roasted, and then shelled and peeled.&nbsp;&nbsp; To roast them, cut an X
      into each shell (to allow steam to escape) and bake them in a 400° oven for
      about twenty minutes.&nbsp; While they're still warm, peel off both the
      shell and the furry skin surrounding each nut.&nbsp; Alternatively, boil
      the chestnuts for about 15 minutes, then remove them from the water with a
      slotted spoon.&nbsp; Peel off the shells and put the nuts back in
      the boiling water for another minute, then remove them again and peel off
      the skins.&nbsp; Select fresh chestnuts that are shiny and heavy for their
      size.&nbsp; Store them in the refrigerator and use them within a week or
      so.&nbsp; Don't confuse chestnuts with water chestnuts, which are
      completely different.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><i> Substitutes: </i></b>breadnuts

Indian nut = piñon = pignolo = pignoli = snoober = pine kernel</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i><b>
      Notes:</b></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These expensive and delicate seeds are
      harvested from pine trees in different parts of the world.&nbsp; Italians
      like to grind them into pesto or sprinkle them on pasta dishes. &nbsp; There
      are two main varieties:&nbsp; the triangular
Chinese pine nuts sold in Asian markets, and the
slender Italian pine nuts, which are more expensive and subtly
      flavored.&nbsp;&nbsp; All pine nuts are high in fat, so store them in the
      refrigerator or freezer to keep them from getting rancid.&nbsp;&nbsp;Before you use them, toast
      pine nuts in a 325°
oven, stirring occasionally, until they're slightly golden, about five
      minutes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><i>Substitutes:</i></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
      walnuts (this is a common variation in pesto) OR almonds (this is a common
      variation in pesto) OR hazelnuts (this also works in pesto) OR cashews
      (raw, unsalted) OR peanuts (unsalted) OR
sunflower seeds

      green Middle Eastern nuts are encased in tan shells, which are sometimes

      to eat, the shells split open enough that they can be pulled off easily
      with your fingers.&nbsp; Unopened shells contain immature kernels and should be
      discarded.&nbsp; Pistachios are available shelled or unshelled, salted or
      unsalted, roasted or raw.&nbsp;&nbsp;To roast, put shelled pistachios on a
baking pan and in bake them in a 325° oven, stirring occasionally, until

      the nuts from the oven, rub them vigorously with a towel so as to remove
      as much of their bitter skins as possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fresh
      walnuts are available year-round, but they're best in the fall.&nbsp;
      Since they're high in fat and therefore prone to rancidity, it's best to
      store them in the refrigerator or freezer.&nbsp;&nbsp; <i><b>Substitutes:</b> </i> butternuts OR pecans
