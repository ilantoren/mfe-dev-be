  dissolving a spice or flavoring oil in alcohol.&nbsp;&nbsp; Store extracts in

        component in vanilla, so even the best imitation vanilla extracts aren't quite
        as full-flavored and complex as the real deal.&nbsp; Food gurus are always saying
        that cooks should never, ever use imitation vanilla extract, but at
        least one taste test has shown that many people prefer a high quality imitation
        vanilla extract to pure extract.&nbsp; Avoid imitation vanilla from Mexico--it

        awhile.&nbsp; When the liquid has been infused with vanilla flavor,
        remove the pod.&nbsp; One
        inch of fresh vanilla bean = one teaspoon
        extract.&nbsp; Use a longer piece of vanilla if it's not fresh.) OR
imitation vanilla extract (This may be less potent than pure vanilla extract, so
        you may need to use more.) OR Kosher vanilla sugar (for
        Passover) OR vanilla-flavored liqueur (1 teaspoon extract = 1 tablespoon liqueur)
        OR almond liqueur (1 teaspoon extract = 1 tablespoon liqueur) OR rum (1
        teaspoon extract = 1 tablespoon rum) OR almond extract (use less) OR
        peppermint extract (use 1/8 as much)

  <p><b>vanilla powder&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Notes:&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></b>&nbsp; This
  alcohol-free powder is
  made from vanilla beans that have been dried and pulverized.&nbsp; Unlike
  vanilla extract, it doesn't evaporate when heated, so it's well suited to
  making custards and other cooked desserts.&nbsp;&nbsp;It's also good for
  making dry mixes and for sprinkling onto drinks and dishes.&nbsp; Some brands
  have sweeteners added.&nbsp; Look for it in larger supermarkets and specialty
  shops.&nbsp; <b><i>Substitutes:&nbsp; </i></b>vanilla extract (Some sources
  suggest substituting this measure for measure.&nbsp; Others suggest using
  twice as much extract as powder.) OR imitation vanilla extract (Some sources
  suggest substituting this measure for measure.&nbsp; Others suggest using
  twice as much extract as powder.)&nbsp;

  <p><b>wine essence = wine extract = wine syrup&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Notes:&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></b>&nbsp;
  This is wine that's been reduced to a syrup, which de-alcoholizes it and allows it to
be stored for a longer period of time.&nbsp; Professional chefs sometimes make
  this to use up half-empty bottles of wine that would
  otherwise go bad in a few days.&nbsp; The syrup can be used in sauces or other
  dishes that call for wine.&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><i>To make your
own:&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></b>  Reduce wine by slowly simmering it in a non-reactive pan (i.e., avoid
aluminum or iron) to a thick, syrupy consistency, then refrigerate it and use
small amounts to flavor dishes.&nbsp;&nbsp; One bottle of wine makes about one
  cup.&nbsp;
