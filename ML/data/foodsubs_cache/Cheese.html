    <td width="69%">Our early ancestors probably discovered cheese when they
      first used animal stomachs to carry milk.&nbsp; An enzyme in the stomachs called rennet
      would have caused the milk to curdle and
      separate into cheese and a watery liquid called whey.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      <p>People have been tinkering with that basic recipe ever since then, and there
      are now hundreds of different kinds of cheeses.&nbsp; Cheese-makers impart different flavors and textures
      into their cheeses by using different milks,
      adding various bacteria and molds, aging for different lengths of time,
      and so forth.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    </td>

  <tr>
    <td width="100%" colspan="2">
    The pâte, or inner portion, of a cheese is normally encased in a
    rind.&nbsp; Natural rinds can be covered or mottled with mold, and they're
    often edible, though many people find them bitter
        and salty.&nbsp;&nbsp;Waxy rinds shouldn't be eaten.
    <p>
    <b><i>Tips:</i></b>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Always bring a table cheese to room temperature before serving it--the flavor is much
        better.</li>
      <li>Younger cheeses tend to be mild, soft, and moist.&nbsp; As cheeses
        age, they become more pungent, hard, and crumbly.</li>
      <li>Many cheeses become rubbery when cooked too long or at too high a
        temperature.&nbsp; If you plan to cook with a cheese,&nbsp; select a heat-tolerant
        one like mozzarella or Emmental.</li>
      <li>It's usually best to keep cheese in its original packaging.&nbsp; If
        the cheese has been cut, wrap it tightly in plastic wrap to hold in the
        moisture.&nbsp; If it hasn't been cut, wrap it first with waxed paper
        and then with plastic wrap--this allows the cheese to
        breathe.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Store cheese near the bottom of the refrigerator, where
        temperature fluctuations are minimal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
      <li> Harder cheeses have a longer shelf life than soft, moist ones.</li>
      <li>Don't freeze cheese--it ruins the flavor.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Just as you'd ask your fishmonger &quot;What's fresh today?&quot; ask
        your cheesemonger &quot;What's ripe today?&quot;</li>
      <li>Under-ripe cheeses haven't fully developed their flavor, while
        overripe cheeses become acidic and unpleasantly pungent.&nbsp; Some
        overripe cheeses develop a strong ammonia smell.</li>
      <li>If a small amount of mold forms on the surface of the cheese, cut it
        off along with a half an inch of cheese on all sides of it.&nbsp;
        If there's a lot of mold, throw the cheese out.</li>
      <li>Many lactose-intolerant people find that they can tolerate low-lactose
        cheeses like cream cheese, cottage cheese, Mozzarella, and Provolone.</li>
      <li>Don't serve cheese with citrus or tropical fruits.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Cheese is usually made with pasteurized milk, which has been heated to
        remove harmful bacteria.&nbsp; Unfortunately, pasteurization also
        destroys
        friendly bacteria and enzymes, though some of these can be added back
        artificially once the milk is pasteurized.&nbsp; Some producers insist
        on making cheese with raw (unpasteurized) milk, believing that this gives their
        cheese richer microflora and better flavor and textures.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<b>pressed cheese&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Notes:</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>  These are cheeses which are pressed to remove moisture
during their production, and then soaked in a salt bath and aged.&nbsp; This
broad category includes most semi-firm and firm cheeses.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>During the production of some pressed cheeses, the curds are
cooked to expel even more moisture.&nbsp; These firmer cheeses usually have hard
rinds, which are sometimes coated with wax.&nbsp; <b>Cooked pressed cheeses</b>
include Gruyère, Emmental, Gouda, and Parmesan.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p> <b>Uncooked pressed
cheeses</b> aren't as firm.&nbsp; They're often sweet and fruity when young, and
they develop a more earthy and grassy flavor as they age.&nbsp; Examples include
Cantal, Tommes de Savoie, and Morbier.</p>
