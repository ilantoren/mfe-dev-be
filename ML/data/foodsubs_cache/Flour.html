<ul>

<li>
barley flour (This has a mild flavor and works especially well in pancakes, cookies, and quick
breads.&nbsp; Replace up to half of any wheat flour in a recipe with this.&nbsp;
Contains some gluten.)
OR</li>

<li>
buckwheat flour (This is especially good in pancakes.&nbsp; It tends to make
baked goods heavier and stronger tasting.&nbsp; Replace up to half of the wheat flour
in any recipe with this.&nbsp; Contains some gluten.) OR</li>

<li>
oat flour (This is especially good in quick breads and cookies.&nbsp; It makes
baked goods moister,
chewier, and more crumbly.&nbsp; Contains some gluten.) OR</li>

<li>
brown rice flour (This is especially good for those with wheat allergies; replace up to 1/4
of any wheat flour with this.&nbsp; Baked goods made with rice flour tend to
be crumbly, so consider substituting a mixture of one part arrowroot or other
thickener plus four parts rice flour.&nbsp; Adding more eggs is another way to reduce
crumbliness.&nbsp; Since rice flour absorbs more moisture, you may need to add
more liquid to recipe.) OR</li>

<li>
corn flour (This is a good substitute for those with wheat allergies.) OR</li>

<li>
millet flour (This has a more pronounced flavor than all-purpose flour, and it tends to make
baked goods coarse and dry.&nbsp; Replace up to 1/5 of any wheat flour with
this.) OR</li>

<li>
potato flour (Replace up to 1/4 of any wheat flour in a recipe with this.&nbsp;
Substitute
5/8 cup potato flour for 1 cup all-purpose flour.) OR</li>

<li>
soy flour (This is high in protein, but has a very strong flavor.&nbsp; Replace up to 1/4 of any
wheat flour with this, then increase the liquid in the recipe and reduce the oven temperature
by 25 degrees.) OR</li>

<li>
quinoa flour (This is higher in fat than all-purpose flour, so it tends to make
baked goods moister.&nbsp; Replace up to 1/2 of the wheat flour in the recipe with
this.) OR</li>

<li>
non-waxy rice flour (This is good for those with wheat allergies.&nbsp; Replace up to
1/4 of any wheat flour with this.&nbsp; Baked goods made with rice flour tend
to be crumbly, so consider substituting a mixture of one part arrowroot or
other thickener plus four parts rice flour.&nbsp; Adding more eggs is another way to
reduce crumbliness.&nbsp;&nbsp; Since rice flour absorbs more moisture than
all-purpose flour, you may need
to add more liquid to the recipe or substitute only 7/8 C rice flour for each
cup of all-purpose flour.) OR</li>

<li>
wheat germ (This makes for a more nutritious product.&nbsp; Replace up to 1/3 of
the flour with this.) OR</li>

<li>
amaranth flour (This is higher in fat than all-purpose flour.) OR</li>

<li>
spelt flour (This tends to make baked goods heavier, so consider increasing the baking powder
so that the product rises more.&nbsp;&nbsp; Spelt is tolerated by most people with wheat
allergies, and it's great for making pasta and bread.) OR</li>

<li>
kamut flour (This is tolerated by most people with wheat allergies, and it works
well in pasta and bread recipes.&nbsp; It works best if combined with other
flours.) OR</li>

medium rye flour (Replace up to one-third of the wheat flour in a bread recipe with

handle the dough as little as possible, chill the fat before cutting it
into the flour, add the minimal amount of liquid, and consider adding more
fat to the recipe.)</td>
