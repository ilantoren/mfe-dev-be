      <td width="58%">Poultry is the catch-all term for domesticated birds that
        are meaty enough to eat.&nbsp; Poultry tends to be lower in saturated
        fat than other meats, so it's a good choice if you're worried about your
        health or weight.&nbsp; You can lower the fat still more by removing the skin
        and by using light meat from the breast instead of the darker meat from
        the thighs and legs.&nbsp; Younger birds are more tender than older
        ones, so they're best for grilling, roasting, and frying.&nbsp; Older,
        tougher birds do better if they're cooked in stews or soups.</td>

 When selecting
      your turkey, make sure that the plastic wrapping isn't torn.&nbsp; There's no big difference between males (toms) and females
      (hens), but it's more economical&nbsp; to get a big bird, since a 15-pound turkey has
      about twice as much meat on it as a 10-pound turkey.&nbsp; Frozen
      turkeys should be thawed in the refrigerator, allowing one day of thawing
      per 5 pounds of bird.&nbsp; If you're short of time, you can thaw a turkey
      by leaving it in its original plastic wrapper and covering it completely
      with cold water, changing the water every 30 minutes.&nbsp; Allow 30
      minutes of thawing time per pound of bird if you use this method.&nbsp;
      Fresh turkeys should be used within two days of purchase.&nbsp; Cut-up
      turkeys are also available.&nbsp; The major cuts are the turkey breast,
      tenderloin, cutlet, drumstick, and thigh. &nbsp;Click <a href="Defrost.html#turkey">here</a>
