  <P align="left"><i><b>Tips:</b></i></P>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p align="left">Before you add a thickener to a sauce, skim the fat from
      the top.&nbsp; Once you've added the thickener, the fat will be harder to remove.</li>
    <li>
      <p align="left">Flour is a good thickener for gravies, gumbos, and stews,
      since it gives them a smooth, velvety texture.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's best to
      mix it with fat first, either by making a roux or beurre manié, or by
      flouring and frying stew meat before adding a liquid to the pot.&nbsp; If
      you wish to cut fat from your diet, you can instead mix the flour with water and add it to the
      sauce, but you'll need to cook it for quite awhile
      to get rid of the starchy, raw flour taste.&nbsp; Sauces thickened with
      flour become opaque, and they may become become thin again if they're cooked too long or
      if they're frozen and then thawed.</li>
    <li>
      <p align="left">Starch thickeners like cornstarch are mixed with an equal
      amount of cold water, then added to warm liquids to thicken
  them.&nbsp;&nbsp; They're a good choice if you want a low-fat, neutral-tasting
      thickener.&nbsp; They give dishes a glossy sheen, which looks wonderful if
      you're making a dessert sauce or pie filling, but a bit artificial in a
      gravy or stew.</li>
    <li>
      <p align="left">If you get lumps in your sauce from a thickener, blend the
      sauce in a blender or food processor until it's smooth.</li>
    <li>
      <p align="left">Cereal grains like oatmeal, couscous, soup pasta, farina,
      are often used to thicken soups.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
    <li>
      <p align="left">Reduction is a slow but low-fat way of thickening sauces
      and concentrating flavors.&nbsp; Just cook down the sauce in an uncovered pan until it's
      thickened to your liking.</li>
    <li>
      <p align="left">Meat and fish glaces are a time-consuming--or expensive,
      if you buy them ready-made--way of thickening and enriching sauces.&nbsp;
      They're made by reducing stocks until they're thick and gelatinous.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>
      <p align="left">A good way to thicken soups or stews is to add grated
  starchy vegetables, or to purée the vegetables in the sauce. &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
    <li>
      <p align="left"> Nuts make good, flavorful thickeners for stews, though
      they're often expensive and high in fat.&nbsp; Just grind them down to a
      flour or butter, and add them to the dish.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>
      <p align="left">Egg yolks add a silky, velvety texture to soups and
      sauces, but they'll turn into scrambled eggs if they're not introduced
      carefully into the hot liquid.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
    <li>
      <p align="left">Cream, once reduced, gives sauces a rich texture and flavor as it
      thickens them, but it's high in fat.&nbsp; To make a low-fat cream sauce,
      use evaporated milk mixed with a starch thickener.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>
      <p align="left">Yogurt is a popular soup thickener in Eastern Europe and
      the Middle East.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

  mixture is used to correct overly thin sauces at the last minute.&nbsp; To
  make it, blend equal weights of butter and flour, then knead them
  together.&nbsp; After you whisk it into a sauce, let it cook for no more than
  a minute or two, since sauces thickened with flour pick up a starchy taste
  after they've cooked for a few minutes.&nbsp; <b><i>Substitutes:&nbsp; </i></b>roux
  (This is another flour-butter thickener, but the sauce should cook for at
  least 30 minutes to rid itself of the flour's starchy flavor.) OR tapioca
  starch (This also works quickly, and it's a good choice for correcting sauces
  at the last minute.)</p>

<p><b>egg yolk&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Notes:&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></b> Egg yolks make
wonderful thickeners--imparting both a rich flavor and velvety smooth
texture--but they're tricky to use.&nbsp; You can't just whisk them into a
simmering sauce--they'd curdle on contact.&nbsp; Instead, you need to
&quot;temper&quot; them by adding some of the hot liquid to the egg yolks,
whisking the mixture together, and then adding it to the sauce.&nbsp; To prevent
the yolks from coagulating, you need to keep the sauce below 190°, although
this rule can be broken if the sauce has a lot of flour in it.&nbsp; Finally,
never cook sauces with egg yolks in aluminum pans or they'll turn
gray.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

      2 tablespoons liquid pectin = 4 teaspoons powdered pectin&nbsp;&nbsp; <i><b>Pronunciation:&nbsp;</b></i>&nbsp; PECK-tin&nbsp;&nbsp;
      <i><b>Notes: &nbsp;</b></i> In order to make preserves like jams and
      jellies, you normally cook together fruit, acid, sugar, and pectin, a
      substance found in certain fruits that gels when heated.&nbsp; Some fruits
      -- like quinces, gooseberries, tart apples, and sour plums -- contain
      enough natural pectin that they'll thicken all by themselves into
      preserves.&nbsp; Others, like cherries and some berries, need an extra
      boost to firm up.&nbsp; Jam recipes for pectin-deficient fruit
      normally call for liquid or powdered pectin, which you can find among the
      baking supplies in most supermarkets.&nbsp; The recipes usually specify what brand of pectin to
      use, and it's not a good idea to
substitute one brand for another, since they have different formulas. &nbsp;Some
      brands (like Sure Jell and Certo) need acid and sugar to set, some (like Sure Jell for Low Sugar
      Recipes) need acid
and just a little sugar to set, some
(like Pomona's Universal Pectin® or Mrs. Wages Lite Home Jell Fruit Pectin®) don't need any
      sugar to set.&nbsp;&nbsp; Liquid pectin contains sulfite, which can cause an
      allergic reaction in people with sulfite sensitivites, but powdered pectin
      does not.

  it won't set up sufficiently to make puddings or custards. A little goes a
  long way, so use about half as much as you would a starch thickener.&nbsp;</p>
